    "Many modern proposals for near-future Mars and lunar habitation rely on habitats and crewed volumes located underground or beneath thick layers of regolith for radiation protection. This has substantial benefits for reducing launched mass while reducing crew health effects, as shielding of a few metres of locally-acquired regolith can reduce radiation levels in the habitat to safe levels without requiring many tonnes of water or metal to be launched as part of the habitat assembly. However the low thermal conductivity of regoliths, and the large thicknesses required, make this a challenging thermal design scenario. Syrtis allows for the analysis of habitats under layers of regolith, buried entirely below the surface and inside large lava tubes."

The upward stacked bar, which begins at some distance below the x-axis, shows the heat sinks present in the system. The most significant of these are radiative losses to the sky and ground, although convection is significant for both and ground conduction plays a reasonable role in the horizontal system. \n",
