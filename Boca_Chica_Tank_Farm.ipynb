    "To demonstrate the StaticShell feature of Syrtis, we can analyse a simple system. SpaceX have made use of large double-walled steel tanks to store huge volumes of cryogenic propellants at their Boca Chica facility. These have an inner wall diameter of around 9m (to allow common tooling with the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle) and an outer wall diameter of around 12m. The gap between them is believed to be filled with expanded perlite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice to use perlite rather than a simple air gap, as well as the dimensions of this gap, can be crudely analysed with Syrtis. It should be noted that this is not an intended use for the solver, as it uses the enormously dense terrestrial atmosphere, but serves as an interesting demonstration."

    "## Results\n",
    "The behaviour for perlite is roughly as expected - a monotonic decrease as diameter increases. For very thin gaps the heat gain is higher for perlite due to the greater static thermal conductivity of the material. It is obvious that a thicker insulation layer is always better. As such, the approximately 1.5m thick layer that SpaceX ultimately chose (for a 12m external diameter) is likely due to tooling and transport limitations rather than a desire to minimise heat flux. With 1.5m of perlite insulation the heat flux is just 23kW, a few percent of the uninsulated loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviour for air seems rather odd, as it does not behave in a similar fashion. This is due to the natural convection model that Syrtis uses to determine the thermal resistance of gas-filled insulation layers. The difference between a conduction-only and conduction plus natural convection model is shown below. \"Non-convecting air\" describes a hypothetical material with the thermal conductivity of air but without the ability to flow in convection currents. This is approximately the property of aerogel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decrease and then increase for convecting air is due to the formation of larger and larger convection cells - and thus more effective heat transfer - as the gap width increases. It would in theory be possible to choose a gap width that minimises heat flux, but this would be highly dependent on the temperature and pressure properties of the gas. As such it might be unwise to choose this!"
